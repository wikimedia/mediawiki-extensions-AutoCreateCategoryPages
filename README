Auto Create Category Page 
(https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Auto_Create_Category_Page)
(what a mouthful!) is a MediaWiki extension which automatically creates
stub pages for non-existent categories as soon as they are linked to,
avoiding the confusing default behavior of "There is currently no text in
this page..." or redirecting to the edit page.


== Compatibility ==
Tested with MediaWiki 1.21.x and MediaWiki 1.22alpha.

== Installation ==
See INSTALL file for configuration options.

=== Caveats ===
This extension is currently not recommended for use on large wikis, as it
doesn't implement any caching of its database queries (for retrieving
the list of existing category pages).

== Credits ==
<em>Auto Create Category Pages</em> was originally created as
"Uniwiki Auto Create Category Pages" by Merrick Schaefer, Mark Johnston,
Evan Wheeler & Adam Mckaig, as part of the Uniwiki project for UNICEF
(see [https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Category:Uniwiki Category:Uniwiki]).


As Uniwiki extensions for MediaWiki are not maintained by the original
developers anymore, according to an e-mail by Mark Johnston from Nov 9, 2012,
the maintenance of this one extension was taken up by 
[https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:FreedomFighterSparrow Dror S.]

== License ==
The extension was released under GPLv3. See LICENSE file for more details.

== Short changelog ==
* Version 0.1, 01-Aug-2008: original release.
* Version 0.2, 28-Oct-2013: updated to work with MW 1.21.x & MW 1.22alpha.
